Description: Implements a one-sector Armington-CES gravity model with general equilibrium (GE) effects. This model is designed to analyze international and domestic trade by capturing the impacts of trade costs and policy changes within a general equilibrium framework. Additionally, it includes a local parameter to run simulations on productivity. The package provides functions for calibration, simulation, and analysis of the model.
